<h2 style="font-size:20px">HARDWARE CATEGORIES (Functional Parts)</h2>
<p>A computer system is a set of integrated devices that input, output, process, and store data and information. Computer systems are currently built around at least one digital processing device. There are five main hardware components in a computer system: Input, Processing, Storage, Output and Communication devices.</p>
<ol>
<li id="input"><b><a name="_Toc398399507"></a><span>.INPUT DEVICES</span></b></li>
<p>Are devices used for entering data or instructions to the central processing unit. Are classifie according to the method they use to enter data.</p>
<p><strong>A. KEYING DEVICES</strong><br/>
Are devices used to enter data into the computer using a set of Keys eg Keyboard, key-to- storage and keypad.<br/>
<br/>
i) THE KEYBOARD<br/>
</p>
<p>Keyboard (similar to a typewriter) is the main input device of a computer . It contains three types of keys-- alphanumeric keys, special keys and function keys.
<strong>Alphanumeric keys</strong> are used to type all alphabets, numbers and special symbols like $, %, @, A etc. <strong>Special keys</strong> such as &lt;Shift&gt;, &lt;Ctrl&gt;, &lt;Alt&gt;, &lt;Home&gt;, &lt;Scroll Lock&gt; etc. are used for special functions.
 <strong>Function keys</strong> such as &lt;Fl&gt;, &lt;F2&gt;, &lt;F3&gt; etc. are used to give special commands depending upon the software used e.g.F5 reloads a page of an internet browser. The function of each and every key can be well understood only after working on a PC.
 When any key is pressed, an electronic signal is produced. This signal is detected by a keyboard encoder that sends a binary code corresponding to the key pressed to the CPU. There are many types of keyboards but 101 keys keyboard is the most popular one.</p> <br />

<p><b><strong><br/>
B. POINTING DEVICES<br/>
</strong></b>Are devices that enter data and instructions into the computer using a pointer that appears on the screen. The items to be entered are selected by either pointing to or clicking on them.e.g mice, joystick, touch sensitive screen, trackballs<br/>
<br/>
 i) THE MOUSE</strong><br/>
A mouse is a small device used to point to and select items on your computer screen. Although mice come in many shapes, the typical mouse does look a bit like an actual mouse. It's small, oblong, and connected to the system unit by a long wire that resembles a tail and the connector which can either be PS/2 or USB. Some newer mice are wireless.</p>
<p>A mouse usually <b>has two buttons:</b> a primary button (usually the left button) and a secondary button. Many mice also have a wheel between the two buttons, which allows you to scroll smoothly through screens of information.</p>
<p>When you move the mouse with your hand, a pointer on your screen moves in the same direction. (The pointer's appearance might change depending on where it's positioned on your screen.) When you want to select an item, you point to the item and then <span>click</span> (press and release) the primary button. Pointing and clicking with your mouse is the main way to interact with your computer. There are several types of mice: Mechanical mouse, optical mouse, optical-mechanical mouse and laser mouse.</p>
<p><strong>Basic parts</strong></p>
<p><span>A mouse typically has two buttons: a <span>primary button</span> (usually the left button) and a <span>secondary button</span> (usually the right button). The primary button is the one you will use most often. Most mice also include a <span>scroll wheel</span> between the buttons to help you scroll through documents and WebPages more easily. On some mice, the scroll wheel can be pressed to act as a third button. Advanced mice might have additional buttons that can perform other functions.<br/>

<p><b>C) SCANNING DEVICES<br/>
</b>Are devices that capture an object or a document directly from the source. They are classifie according to the technology used to capture data e.g. Scanners and Document readers<b>.<br/>
i) Scanners<br/>
</b>Used to capture a source document and converts it into an electronic<b> f</b>orm. <br/>
 Example are - FlatBed and HandHeld scanners<b>.<br/>

<li id="output"><b>OUTPUT DEVICES</b></li>
</ol>
<p>An output device is essentially a piece of instrument or computer hardware that retrieves data from a computer system 
and further translates the received data into a form understandable to humans. 
The most common human-understandable forms typically include text, visual, audio, or a hard copy (printed on a paper). 
In simple words, an output device is a type of peripheral device that helps us to get data processed from a computer,
 usually in the form of audio, visual, and xerox.</p>
 <p>Examples of output devices include</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Monitor</li>
 <li>printer</li>
 <li>speaker</li>
 <li>  projector</li>
 </ul>

<p id="cpu"><b>THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT ( C P U)</b></p><br/>
</b>Is the brain or the heart of a computer. Is also known as processor and consist of three units namely - <br/>
 i) Control Unit ( C U)<br/>
 ii) Arithmetic logic Unit ( A L U)<br/>
 iii) Main Memory unit ( M M U<strong>)<br/>
<br/>
</strong><span>The <span>system unit</span> is the core of a computer system. Usually it's a rectangular box placed on or underneath your desk. Inside this box are many electronic components that process data. The most important of these components is the <span>central processing unit (CPU)</span>, or <span>microprocessor</span>, which acts as the &quot;brain&quot; of your computer. Another component is <span>random access memory (RAM)</span>, which temporarily stores information that the CPU uses while the computer is on. The information stored in RAM is erased when the computer is turned off. </span></p>
<p><span>Almost every other part of your computer connects to the system unit using cables. The cables plug into specific <span>ports</span> (openings), typically on the back of the system unit. Hardware that is not part of the system unit is sometimes called a <span><strong>peripheral device. </strong></span>Peripheral devices can be <strong>external</strong> such as a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/mouse.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">mouse</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/K/keyboard.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">keyboard</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/printer.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">printer</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/monitor.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">monitor</a>, external <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/Z/Zip_drive.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Zip drive</a> or <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/S/scanner.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">scanner</a> or <strong>internal</strong>, such as a <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CD_ROM_drive.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">CD-ROM drive</a>, <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/CD_R_drive.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">CD-R drive</a> or internal <a href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/M/modem.html" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">modem</a>.

<p align="center" id="soft"><b><u>COMPUTER SOFTWARE </u></b></p> <br/>
<p>Computer software refers to programming code that is executed on the computer hardware that facilitates the completion of tasks by a computer.
it is also the set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer
Software can be physically stored on the hard drive or at another location such as a USB drive, or it can be cloud-based and hosted over the internet.
Computer software examples include operating systems, which allow for easy use of a computer's processing power, as well as applications like Notepad and Firefox.</p> 
<br/>
<img  src="software.png" alt="images of softwares programes" class="center"/>
<p>The two main categories of computer software are:</p>
<ul>
<li>System software</li>
<li>Applicationsoftware</li>
</ul> 

<p id="system"><b>SYSTEM SOFTWARE</b><br/>
These software programs are designed to run a computer's application programs and hardware. System software coordinates the activities and functions of the hardware and software. In addition, it controls the operations of the computer hardware and provides an environment or platform for all the other types of software to work</p>
<p><b>System software</b> is used to manage the computer itself. It runs in the background, maintaining the computer's basic functions so users can run higher- level application software to perform certain tasks. Essentially, system software provides a platform for application software to be run on top of.</p>
<p><b>Examples of system software include:</b>
<ul>
<li>operating systems (OS) like macOS, Linux, Android and Microsoft Windows</li>
<li>Utility Software</li>
<li>Firmware</li>
<li>Device Drivers</li>
<li> computational science software</li>
<li> game engines</li>
<li> search engines</li>
<li> industrial automation</li>
<li>software as a service applications.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p id="app"><b>APPLICATION SOFTWARE</b> <br/>
Application software is another type of computer software, one that is less technical than system software. Users are generally much more familiar with application software because it includes the programs that allow users to perform tasks
<b>Application software</b> is also a computer software package that performs a specific function directly for an end user or, in some cases, for another application.</p>

<p><b>some of the types of the application software include:</b>
<ul>
<li>Web browsers</li>
<li>Word processors</li>
<li>Multimedia software</li>
<li>Spreadsheet software</li>
<li>Graphics software</li>
<li>Database programs</li>
<li>Web browsers</li>
<li>Deployment tools</li>
<li>Image editors</li>
<li>Communication platforms</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p align="center" id="live"><b><u>LIVEWARE</u></b></p><br/>
<p>Liveware is a term to describe the human system, opposed to hardware or software in a computer.
 Or liveware is a working personnel, especially computer personnel, as distinct from the inanimate or abstract things they work with.
Examples of  liveware include professional computer engineers, hardware engineers, and network or database administrators. 
It also includes any other person working on the computer. The various types of software include application software and operating software. 
Other words meaning the same or similar to liveware include wetware, meatware and jellyware.
<ul>
Functions of liveware includes:
<li> structural support</li>
<li> environmental control</li>
<li> operate computer system, etc.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> Computer hardwares are needed to be replaced when it gets failed and does not work properly.
People need to increase their knowledge and skills with changing technologies to work efficiently with new technologies.</p> <br />
